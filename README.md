# Functionality of programs 
In the first program a variable "num" is created for taking & storing numerical integer input from the user.
Then if condition is used to check whether the number is divisible by 2 or not which will decide whether it's an even number or an odd number.

In the second program a variable "res" is created to store the sum of all the integers from 1 to 50 & initially it's initialised as 0.
Another variable "num" is also created to traverse over the for loop and lastly the value of "res" is printed as an output.
